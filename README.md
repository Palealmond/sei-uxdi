# Joint Group Project with UX/UI

### Description

Basic Mobile first app for a coffee and pastry/bagel shop. Has assets of pastries and bagels, working carousels featuring pictures of pastries and coffees. Implemented a greeting and dark mode.

#### Successes

Implementation of the dark mode, and most of the asks from the UX/UI team. Also very smooth communication and teamwork from both teams from UX/UI and SEI. 

#### Blockers

Deployment was a slight issue but in hindsight not as bad as future projects. Also git pushes and commits were an issue. 

### Future Goals

To clean up / expand the UI all around, update so it is also browser friendly (instead of being mobile only)
